# 0x19. Postmortem

A __postmortem__ is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

    To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
    And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.

Things that should be included in a postmortem:

    A clear description of the incident, including the date, time, and duration of the event.

    A timeline of events leading up to the incident, including any warning signs or alerts that were triggered.

    A summary of the impact of the incident, including how many users were affected, the severity of the impact, and any financial or reputational damage that was caused.

    An analysis of the root cause(s) of the incident, including any contributing factors or dependencies that may have played a role.

    A list of action items and recommendations for how to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including any changes to policies, procedures, or technology.

Things that should not be included in a postmortem:

    Blame or finger-pointing. A postmortem should focus on identifying the root cause of an incident, not assigning blame to specific individuals or teams.

    Personal opinions or emotions. A postmortem should be an objective analysis of the incident, not a platform for personal grievances or opinions.

    Incomplete or inaccurate information. It's important to gather all the relevant facts and data before conducting a postmortem to ensure that the analysis is thorough and accurate.

    Irrelevant details or distractions. A postmortem should focus on the incident at hand and not be sidetracked by unrelated topics or issues.
