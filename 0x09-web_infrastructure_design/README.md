## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m_O2HLsKrO1zg31LMcLOGQ "imgur") but feel free to use anything you want).
- For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
- Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
- Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
- Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in
    details if not asked
